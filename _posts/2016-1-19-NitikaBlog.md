###This is just a place for me to talk about my experience at Metis.

####Week 1

Today marks the end of week 1 and it has been quit a week so far. I knew that my life at metis was going to be no cakewalk but realized the first day what that really meant. I live in Long Island, NY so it's quite a commute for me to get in everyday. I wake up at 5:30 everyday and take the 7:15 train. I leave the house at 7:00 am every morning and the earliest I have gotten home this week is at 9:30 pm. The strange part is....**I LOVE EVERY SECOND OF IT**!!.

##### Project Benson


Our task was to help group WTWY in their efforts to optimize their street team in collecting emails , in hopes of raising awareness of their organization and eventually maximizing participation.

The [turnstile data](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html)  includes entry and exit counts for each subway station, measured in four hour intervals at inconsistent times. Since our clients event was early summer, we decided to use data from April 2015 since it was close to the month of the event and would be the best time to spread the word about the event. We also decided to link our data to census data to include demographic information in our analysis. 

Out first piece of analysis was to look at the average entries by day in April 2015 per station.

We found that the top 5 stations were commuter stations and were also the stations with the most number of lines. 

Next we wanted to look at each station andt the proportion of travel by weekday. We wanted to see if certain stations had more traffic on certain days vs the others.

Surprisingly, we found that the distribution of travel per station was pretty even during the week. The only exception was Wall St, where there was less traffic on Fridays and Saturdays. 

We wanted to encorporate the census data into our analysis.The ideal area to recruit for WTWY Gala would rank highly in the following categories:

Female to Male Ratio 


  * Population employed in Professional & Scientific Industry
  * Females in Labor Force
  * Population Taking Public Transit to Work
  * Households with Income > $100,000

Top travelled stations were scored based on a weighted sum of ideal population parameters and average overall station entries.

The top stations to target are on the left side of the chart below with the top stations to target on the bottom left.
