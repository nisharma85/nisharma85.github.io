title: My life at Metis!

####This is just a place for me to talk about my experience at Metis.

#####Week 1

Today marks the end of week 1 and it has been quit a week so far. I knew that my life at metis was going to be no cakewalk but realized the first day what that really meant. I live in Long Island, NY so it's quite a commute for me to get in everyday. I wake up at 5:30 everyday and take the 7:15 train. I leave the house at 7:00 am every morning and the earliest I have gotten home this week is at 9:30 pm. The strange part is....***I LOVE EVERY SECOND OF IT***!!.
